            What is difference between local storage and session storage?

            <span class="font-bold">Answer:</span>
            Local storage and session storage stores data in client's computer
            by using key-value pair format. But the main difference between
            local and session storage is that storing data in local storage has
            no expiration date, on the other hand, session storage has an
            expiration date. After closing the window session storage data has
            been destroyed. Capacity of localstorage is 10 mb while session
            storage capacity is 4kb. Session storage can send a request but
            localstorage can't send a request.

            What is difference between Global scope and Block scope?
          </h2>
          <p>
            <span class="font-bold">Answer:</span> The variables defined outside
            of any function or curly brackets are known as global variables and
            have global scope. Global scope means that the variables can be
            accessed from any part of that program, any function or conditional
            state can access that variable. Block scope is also a sub-type of
            local scope. The block scope can be defined as the scope of the
            variables inside the curly brackets {}. Now, these curly brackets
            can be of loops, or conditional statements, or something else. this
            is only allowed to refer to these variables from within the curly
            brackets {}.

          <h2 class="card-title">How does work "Event loop" in javascript?</h2>
          <p>
            <span class="font-bold">Answer:</span> An event loop is often the
            main loop in a program that typically waits for the user to trigger
            something.It has one simple job to monitor the Call Stack and the
            Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take
            the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack,
            which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the
            Event Loop.

          <p>
            <span class="font-bold">Answer:</span> We can fine many type of
            undefind in javascript.That are given below:-<br />
            A variable that has not been assigned a value is of type undefined .
            The datatype of a variable that holds an undefined value is also
            'undefined'. A method or statement also returns undefined if the
            variable that is being evaluated does not have an assigned value. A
            function returns undefined if a value was not returned.
